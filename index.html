						<h3>THE QUICK AND DIRTY</h3>

						<p>Since the dawn of the online era (drumroll), HAUS has been instrumental in shaping how brands and institutions look, feel and integrate into the lives of online denizens.</p>

						<h3>WHY LOS ANGELES</h3>
						<p>The Los Angeles calling card for the international elite has for decades been the ability to combine metropolitan vibrancy with access to the great outdoors. Add the 60&#39s pioneering modernism movement in architecture and you have the perfect schematic for our studio.</p>
						<p>But the most important thing about Los Angeles is its unique combination of entertainment and technology. Nowhere on the planet are these two industries so competitive and so closely intertwined. It&#39s a perfect match for our services.</p>
